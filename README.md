rft-framework
=============

Framework of Rational Function Tester

1. create a new workspace.
2. create 2 RFT projects named with "sva-rft-core" , "sva-rft-sample" and "sva-rft-template".
3. import the 3 attachments file into the the projects above.
4. modify the Build Path of the projects:
    4.1 add the jar files of lib folder into the Build Path's Libraries of "sva-rft-core"
    4.2 add "sva-rft-core" project into the Build Path's Projects of "sva-rft-sample"
    4.3 add "sva-rft-core" project into the Build Path's Projects of "sva-rft-template"

You can run the "sva-rft-sample/testscripts/TS_XXX01" for a sample and the report will be generated into "reports/".
If you have any problems or need some new features about the framework, you're welcome to contact with me.
